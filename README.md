Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I specialize in the Internet of Things (IoT), where I've been working on projects that connect the physical and digital worlds in innovative ways. I'm passionate about the potential of IoT to transform industries and everyday life.

Currently, I'm also expanding my skill set by learning frontend development. I believe that combining these two areas of expertise will allow me to create seamless, user-friendly experiences that bring the power of IoT to end users in meaningful ways.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on exciting projects!
